            <p><em>Introduction</em><br>
            Imagine you come home one evening and hear the persistent drip-drip of a leaky faucet. This common household problem is akin to encountering a bug in a software program. Just as a leaky faucet disrupts the smooth flow of water, a bug disrupts the smooth functioning of a software program.</p>

            <p class="act">Act 1: Identifying the Problem</p>
            <p>Software Debugging: The first step in debugging is realizing there's a problem in the code that needs fixing.<br>
            Leaky Faucet: You notice water dripping from your kitchen faucet.</p>

            <p class="act">Act 2: Investigation</p>
            <p>Software Debugging: You examine the code, looking for anomalies or errors that could be causing the problem.<br>
            Leaky Faucet: You inspect the faucet, checking the handle, spout, and connections to see where the leak originates.</p>

            <p class="act">Act 3: Hypothesis and Testing</p>
            <p>Software Debugging: You form a hypothesis about what might be causing the bug and test it by modifying the code.<br>
            Leaky Faucet: You hypothesize that the washer inside the faucet might be worn out and replace it to see if it stops the leak.</p>

            <p class="act">Act 4: Solution and Verification</p>
            <p>Software Debugging: If your fix works, you review the code to ensure it doesnâ€™t affect other parts of the program.<br>
            Leaky Faucet: After replacing the washer, you turn on the faucet to ensure it no longer leaks and that water flow is normal.</p>

            <p class="act">Act 5: Reflection and Learning</p>
            <p>Software Debugging: You learn from the bug and consider ways to prevent similar issues in the future.<br>
            Leaky Faucet: You understand what caused the leak and take steps to maintain the faucet better to prevent future leaks.</p>

            <p><strong>Analogy: Unraveling a Tangled Set of Headphones</strong></p>

            </div>
            <p><em>Introduction</em><br>
            Picture yourself reaching into your bag to pull out your headphones, only to find them in a tangled mess. This situation is akin to encountering a bug in software. The tangled headphones disrupt the straightforward use, just as a bug disrupts the smooth functioning of software.</p>

            <p class="act">Act 1: Discovering the Problem</p>
            <p>Software Debugging: The first step in debugging is recognizing there's an issue in the code that needs attention.<br>
            Tangled Headphones: You discover your headphones are tangled.</p>

            <p class="act">Act 2: Assessing the Situation</p>
            <p>Software Debugging: You review the code to understand how and where the issue might have originated.<br>
            Tangled Headphones: You carefully look over the tangled mess to find the ends and identify the worst knots.</p>

            <p class="act">Act 3: Tackling the Problem</p>
            <p>Software Debugging: You start addressing the issue, slowly untangling the logic, and testing parts of the code.<br>
            Tangled Headphones: You begin to untangle the headphones, working on one knot at a time, checking which parts free up as you go.</p>

            <p class="act">Act 4: Ensuring Everything Works</p>
            <p>Software Debugging: After resolving the bug, you test the entire code to ensure it works as expected.<br>
            Tangled Headphones: Once untangled, you ensure the headphones are working correctly, with no damage to the wires.</p>

            <p class="act">Act 5: Reflection and Prevention</p>
            <p>Software Debugging: You think about how the bug occurred and how similar issues can be prevented.<br>
            Tangled Headphones: You consider how they became tangled and look into ways to store them properly to prevent future tangles.</p>
